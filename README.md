## 1. Japan Birth Demographics (Dashboard)
In this project I analyze and visualize a dataset found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/webdevbadger/japan-birth-statistics). My goal was to make easy-to-digest, interactive visualizations.

- Creating Visualizations
- Story Telling
- Ensuring Data Accuracy

### Findings/Analysis
• Over the past century, Japan has undergone significant demographic shifts, including a post-World War II baby boom followed by a prolonged period of declining birth rates and an aging population since the 1970's.

• Since birth demographics record-keeping began in Japan, there has been a consistent trend of more males being born. 

• Despite Japan's relatively low infant mortality rate, there exists a noticeable gender disparity, with male infants experiencing higher stillbirth and infant mortality rates compared to females.
